# Monday.com Iframe Setup Guide

## Embedding Contest Manager UI in Monday.com
The Contest Manager is optimized for Monday.com iframe embedding.


### 1. Deploy to AWS (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the AWS deployment script
./deploy-aws.sh

# This will give you an HTTPS URL like:
# https://d1234567890.cloudfront.net
```

#### AWS Amplify
```bash
# Connect your GitHub repo to AWS Amplify
# Build settings:
# Build command: npm run build
# Publish directory: build
```

### 3. Configure Monday.com Board

#### Add Custom Widget
1. Go to your Monday.com board
2. Click "+" to add a new view
3. Select "Custom Widget" or "Embedded Content"
4. Enter your Contest Manager URL

#### Widget Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "Contest Manager",
  "url": "https://your-contest-manager-domain.com",
  "height": "800px",
  "width": "100%",
  "allowFullscreen": true,
  "sandbox": "allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms"
}
```

#### Iframe HTML (if using HTML widget)
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://your-contest-manager-domain.com"
  width="100%" 
  height="800px"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-popups">
</iframe>
```

### 4. Environment Configuration for Monday.com

Create a `.env.production` file in your Contest Manager:

```env
# Enable compact mode for Monday.com
REACT_APP_COMPACT_MODE=true

# Enable Monday.com integration
REACT_APP_ENABLE_MONDAY=true
REACT_APP_MONDAY_BOARD_ID=your-board-id

# Your AWS API endpoints
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-gateway.amazonaws.com/prod
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Feature flags for customer service
REACT_APP_ENABLE_TESTING_PANEL=true
REACT_APP_ENABLE_S3_BROWSER=true
REACT_APP_ENABLE_PYTHON_SCRIPTS=true
```

Then rebuild and redeploy:
```bash
npm run build
./deploy-aws.sh
```
